# Garbage-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-CNN-
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classifies images of waste into categories like plastic, metal, glass, paper, and organic. The primary goal is to enhance waste management systems by improving the segregation and recycling process using deep learning technologies.
